# CMPSC311HW3
All you have to do is score a 17/17 after running make and ./tester in the project terminal. The project is currently at 16/17. I already tried printf debugging but I also have the gcc debugger in the launch,json folder.
README.pdf has the project details.
It is a continuation of hw2 . I am attaching its ReadMe named hw2.pdf
The mdaadm_write function is the new function for this hw.
You don't need to change any other function as they are all correct and verified.
I think the problem may be in the following lines(according to me):
--> Line 149
--> Line 155
--> Line 157
in mdadm.c file.
